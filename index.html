      <div class="info">
        <div><p  >Carbon dioxide (CO2). A minor but very important component of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is released
          through natural processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions and through human activities such as
          deforestation, land use changes, and burning fossil fuels. Humans have increased atmospheric CO2 concentration
          by 48% since the Industrial Revolution began. This is the most important long-lived "forcing" of climate
          change</p>.</div>
        <div>Methane. A hydrocarbon gas produced both through natural sources and human activities, including the
          decomposition of wastes in landfills, agriculture, and especially rice cultivation, as well as ruminant
          digestion and manure management associated with domestic livestock. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, methane
          is a far more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but also one which is much less abundant in the
          atmosphere.</div>
        <div>On Earth, human activities are changing the natural greenhouse. Over the last century the burning of fossil
          fuels like coal and oil has increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). This happens
          because the coal or oil burning process combines carbon with oxygen in the air to make CO2. To a lesser
          extent, the clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has increased
          concentrations of greenhouse gases.</div>
